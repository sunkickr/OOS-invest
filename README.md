Tools to make real estate investing easy

## Overview: 

The internet is now wildly used by real estate investors to find information on properties and to make decisions on where to invest. It is an essential tool for out of state investors. This application will make it easy to find properties, analyze deals, and manage investments. 

## Phase one: 

Phase one will be an app where investors can add information about a property such as purchase price, expenses, and rental income, and generate a report of potential ROI and cash flow. Users can easily adjust the purchase price to see how it affects the potential of a deal.  As much information as possible should be auto-populated to facilitate ease of use.
